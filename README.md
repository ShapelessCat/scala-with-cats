## Overview

[Functional Programming Strategies][website] teaches the core concepts and techniques for building practical software in a functional programming style.


## Building

The build requires a lot of heavy machinery:
texlive, node, java, scala, and pandoc and pandoc-crossref.
There are all installed as part of the 
[CI job that builds the book](https://github.com/scalawithcats/scala-with-cats/blob/develop/.github/workflows/publish.yml).
This is always kept up to date, so refer to it for dependencies and their installation.

Once you have the dependencies installed, run `sbt` to open an SBT prompt.
From within `sbt` you can issue the following commands:

- `pdf` builds a PDF version in `dist/scala-with-cats.pdf`;
- `html` builds an HTML version in `dist/scala-with-cats.html`;
- `epub` builds an ePub version in `dist/scala-with-cats.epub`;
- `all` builds all three versions.

The `pdf`, `html`, and `epub` commands are each made of three smaller commands:

- `{foo}Setup` creates temp directories and builds JS/CSS prerequisites for the HTML/ePub versions;
- `mdoc` runs the files in `src/pages` through [mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/) to compile and run the Scala snippets;
- `{foo}Pandoc` runs the output of `mdoc` through [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to produce the output.

There are also `tex` and `json` commands
(and commands like `texSetup`, `jsonPandoc`, and so on)
that build a LaTeX version of the book and a Pandoc AST respectively.
These are useful for debugging the build.
